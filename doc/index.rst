===========

|copyright| 2014-2016 Thomas Khyn

Django generic many-to-many field implementation.

This django application exposes a ``GM2MField`` that combines
the features of the standard Django ``ManyToManyField`` and
``GenericForeighKey`` and that can be used exactly the same way.

It works with Django 1.8+ and has been tested with the latest minor versions of
Python (2.7 and 3.5).
