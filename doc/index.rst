===========

Django generic many-to-many field implementation.

This django application exposes a ``GM2MField`` that combines
the features of the standard Django ``ManyToManyField`` and
``GenericForeighKey`` and that can be used exactly the same way.

It has been tested with Django 1.8, 1.10 and 1.11 and the latest minor
versions of Python (2.7 and 3.5 or 3.6).
